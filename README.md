## 🧠 How Version Detection Works

The extension detects Bootstrap version using:

* `window.bootstrap` (Bootstrap 5)
* jQuery tooltip constructor version (v3/v4)
* Data attributes (`data-toggle`, `data-bs-toggle`)
* Grid class patterns (`col-xs-*`, `ml-*`, `ms-*`)
* Bootstrap CSS CDN version

## 🔒 Permissions Explained

| Permission       | Why It's Needed            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| activeTab        | Modify current webpage     |
| scripting        | Inject scripts dynamically |
| host_permissions | Work on all websites       |

The extension does **not** collect or transmit any data.
